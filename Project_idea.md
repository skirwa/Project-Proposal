# Project Idea: Analysis of terrorism across the globe between 1990 and 2019

The goal is to understand how to explore, analyze and visualize data using R. We will draw data from different data sources, tidy the data, transform (i.e. create new tibbles) 
and visualize the data to provide insight on the tasks below. 

__Tasks Identified:__
1. How do terrorism death rates compare across continents?

- __Variables:__ country, year, death rate 

2. How does the mortality rate of terrorism compare with other causes of death.

- __Variables:__ different causes of deaths (terrorism, illnesses, accidents, natural causes etc), year, country

3. Has global terrorism reduced or increased over the years?

- __Variables:__ country, year, death rate
 
4. How do the different types of terrorism compare, in terms of the most prevalent and the least prevalent types of terrorism?

- __Variables:__ types of terrorism
